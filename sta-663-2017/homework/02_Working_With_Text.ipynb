For example, if the offset is 3, we replace `a` with `d`, `b` with `e` etc. The cipher wraps around so we replace `y` with `b`, `z` with `c` and so on. Punctuation, spaces and numbers are left unchanged. Note that we don't need a decode function - we can just use a negative offset to reverse the encoding.\n",

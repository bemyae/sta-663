# Machine Learning in Python

## Machine learning concept

- [An image classification example](http://rapid-235.vm.duke.edu:5000)
  - Python-powered
    - `opencv` and `scikit-image` for feature extraction
    - `keras` for feature augmentation
    - `scikit-learn` for classification
    - `flask` for web application
    - plus some JavaScript for interactive web features
- Types of learning
  - Unsupervised (clustering, density estimation)
  - Supervised (classification, regression)
  - Reinforcement (reward and punishment)
- Objective of ML
  - Predict outcome from features
  - y = outcome or label
  - X = vector of features
  - y = f(X, Θ) + error
  - Loss function = g(y, f(X, Θ))
- Model evaluation
  - In-sample (training) and out-of-sample (test) errors
  - Cross validation
    - Holdout
    - K-fold
    - LOOCV
  - **Note**: Any step which uses label/outcome information must be included in cross-validation pipeline
- S/L training pipeline
  - Raw data
  - Extract features from raw data
  - Normalize/scale features
  - Select features for use in model
  - Model selection/evaluation
- S/L training process in `scikit-learn`
  - Consistent API for `scikit-learn` classes
    - `fit`
    - `transform`
    - `predict`
    - `fit_transform` for transformations
    - `fit_predict` for clustering
    - `score` for classification and regression
    - `get_params`
    - `set_params`
  - [Feature extraction]((http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html))
    - Domain knowledge useful
    - Consider augmenting with external data sources
    - More specialized tools
      - [From natural language](http://www.nltk.org)
      - [From images](http://scikit-image.org)
      - [From images/video](http://opencv.org)
      - [Image feature augmentation](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/)
      - [From audio](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis)
  - [Normalize/scale features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
      - Necessary for methods based on measures of distance
      - Most commonly
      - **Note**: Must apply same scaling to training and test data
  - [Feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/feature_selection.html)
    - **Note**: Include feature selection in a pipeline
  - [Model selection/evaluation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html)

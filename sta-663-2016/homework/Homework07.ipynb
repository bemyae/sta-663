    "Suppose we have data of the number of failures ($y_i$) for each of 10 pumps in a nuclear plant. We also have the times ($t_i$) at which each pump was observed. We want to model the number of failures with a Poisson likelihood, where the expected number of failure $\\lambda_i$ differs for each pump. Since the time which we observed each pump is different, we need to scale each $\\lambda_i$ by its observed time $t_i$. To be explicit, we assume that $y_i$ has a Poisson distribution with rate $\\mu_i = \\lambda_i t_i$.\n",

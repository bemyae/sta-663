    "**Amhdahls' law** says that the speedup from parallelization is bounded by the ratio of parallelizable to irreducibly serial code in the algorithm. However, for big data analysis, **Gustafson's Law** is more relevant. This says that we are nearly always interested in increasing the size of the parallelizable bits, and the ratio of parallelizable to irreducibly serial code is not a static quantity but depends on data size. For example, Gibbs sampling has an irreducibly serial nature, but for large samples, each iteration may be able perform PDF evaluations in parallel for zillions of data points."

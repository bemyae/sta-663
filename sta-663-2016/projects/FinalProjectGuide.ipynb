    "There is a lot to do, and these are simply suggestions - nobody is expected to do *all* the suggested steps, and there may be alternative strategies you choose to implement. I suggest that you do most of your development in a Jupyter notebook, supplemented by a code editor if necessary (especially if you are writing C/C++), making use of Markdown cells to document what you are doing. That way, you only have to clean up and refine the notebook and you have a final project ready for submission.  \n",

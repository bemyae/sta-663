    "**Note**: As uusal, this work should be your own original effort. Please do not just copy and paste someone else's code from the web - that would be a serious violation of academic integrity. However, if there is an existing implemetation, it would make sense to do a comparative analysis for accuracy, features and execution speed.\n",

    "**Important**: Papers can be found in Sakai/Resources/FinalProjectPapers. If you intend to use a ppaer not in the folder, please remember that it must be aproved by Cliburn/Janice first!\n",

    "For the final project, you will need to implement a \"new\" statistical algorithm in Python from the research literature and write a report on it (in an Jupyter notebook, of course!). As a guide, the report should include most or all of the following sections, although it is up to you which aspects you choose to focus on (e.g. if the algorithm is highly complex, just developing and testing the Python code might be the main emphasis; alternatively, if the algorithm is quite straightforward, the emphasis can be on making a Spark version and benchmarking it):\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this project, you will be working with IPython notebooks, python scripts (e.g. test code), possibly code in other languages (e.g. Cython, C), data files and a MakeFile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "State the research paper you are using. Describe the concept of the algorithm and why it is interesting and/or useful. If appropriate, describe the mathematical basis of the algorithm. Some potential topics for the background include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What problem does it address? \n",
    "- What are known and possible applications of the algorithm? \n",
    "- What are its advantages and disadvantages relative to other algorithms?\n",
    "- How will you use it in your research?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the algorithm as a Python function or family of functions as clearly as possible. Can your code be understood by someone with a similar quantitative background as yours? Does it follow good coding conventions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Write unit tests for your functions and make sure they pass. These should include both common and edge cases (e.g. test at boundaries - what happens if the input is an empty vector etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Profile the performance of the algorithm and identify bottlenecks. Eliminate these bottlenecks where possible using vectorization, Cython and/or just-in-time compiling. Document what you did and the resulting performance improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High performance computing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can identify tasks that can be performed in parallel, parallelize the algorithm. Depending on the algorithm, this may involve the use of parallel or distributed computing (or some combination of them). If the algorithm cannot be parallelized, more weight will be given to how effectively you perform optimization using Cython or just-in-time compilation. Document what you did and the resulting performance improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application and comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply the algorithm to a \"real\" problem (this can be simulated data) to show how it works and to compare it with at least one other algorithm that addresses the same problem from some available Python or R package. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducible analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to perform the entire development process using a new GitHub repository with regular commits. The GitHub repository should contain a Makefile that can run all tests, as well as perform profiling and benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rough Rubric \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Interim submissions will count towards 20% of the grade and the final submission will make up the remaining 80%. The rubric is only meant as a guide - for example, if the algorihtm is highly complex, we will take that into account and give extra credit for a correct algorithm, even if it is not fully optimized.\n",
